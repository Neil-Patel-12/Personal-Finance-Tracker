# Personal-Finance-Tracker
Python project to help me keep track of my expenses.

# How it works
•	Used matplotlib to plot and see the graph <br>
•	Pandas allowed to easily categorize and search for data within the csv files <br>
•	Data_entry.py – collect data from the user, input statements and validating different data <br>
•	Main.py – which handles the main flow of the program <br>
•	CSV file – act as the databas <br>
